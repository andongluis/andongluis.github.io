I am a first-year Computer Science PhD student at Northwestern University, working under Prof. Kris Hammond at the C3 Lab. I am interested in developing and applying AI/ML methods for social good. I believe that by purposefully developing AI for people, we can overcome social challenges and improve how society works. Currently, I am working on improving how people understand legal and legislative documents through AI/ML.

In addition to my professional interests in AI, I am passionate about a variety of topics. Being born and raised in Mexico by Chinese immigrants, I am interested in learning about different cultures, politics, and economics. I am also an avid Bojack Horseman fan.

### Diversity in Computing

I am also interestsed in increasing participation and visibility of computer scientists from diverse backgrounds. I am currently participating as an organizer for the International Meeting on Artificial Intelligence and its Applications ([RIIAA](https://riiaa.org/) from its initials in Spanish), one of the premier venues for fostering the Artificial Intelligence research and applications ecosystem in Latin America.
