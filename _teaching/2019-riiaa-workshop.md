In [RIIAA](https://riiaa.org/) 2019, I instructed (primarily in Spanish) a summer school workshop on Recommender Systems, focusing on Machine Learning techniques and algorithm implementations. I also aided in the reviewing process for selecting the posters that would be accepted in the student poster competition.

For more information on my workshop, check out the [Github repo](https://github.com/andongluis/recsys_tutorial) with the code and presentation that I prepared for the workshop.
