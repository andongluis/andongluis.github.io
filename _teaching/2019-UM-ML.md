During my last semester as an undergraduate at the University of Michigan, I was the lead instructional aide for the Introduction to Machine Learning (EECS 445) course. In addition to helping the instructor supervise the teaching staff and manage logistic planning, I sided with planning course content, writing assignments, designing exams, and overall logistic support. I also:

* lead a weekly discussion session and office hours where I taught students about Machine Learning,
* took a lead role in designing a project using Support Vector Machines for sentiment analysis, and
* helped design and program an image recognition project with Convolutional Neural Networks
