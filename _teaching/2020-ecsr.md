For the winter semester of 2020, I helped mentor two undergraduate students from the University of Michigan as part of the "Explore Computer Science Research" program that aims to improve diversity in CS research. Along with Prof. Sindhu Kutty (University of Michigan), I helped these students explore fairness in Machine Learning (ML) and how fair are recidivism prediction instruments. I also:

* managed the students' technical tasks and direction, as well as aided in defining the guiding research questions.
* aided in writing a successful submission for Grace Hopper Celebration 2020 undergraduate student poster research competition.

I am really proud of what these students have accomplished, and I look forward to seeing them present their results at the virtual Grace Hopper Celebration!
